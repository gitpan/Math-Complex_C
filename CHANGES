 - Remove 'not' from overloads. Apparently achieved nothing anyway, and 5.16
   warns that it's invalid.
 - Devel::Peek::Dump() a couple of variables in t/arith.t, to try and see 
   why tests 10-12 fail - ie iff they fail && if Devel::Peek is available.
   (Only reported failure I know of is
   http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/e8c48154-9492-11e0-9abf-e615ed0326e0.)

0.04
 - Add is_neg_zero() function. (Perl will often present '-0' as '0'.)
 - Add aab_neg_zero.t to check how the compiler deals with -0, and whether
   is_neg_zero() functions correctly.

0.03
 - Fix assign_cl - internally it was assigning a double instead of a long double.
 - Skip (rather than fail) tests that are known to be failing because
   of compiler bugs.
 - Change _overload_equiv to cater for comparison with real numbers, as
   well as complex numbers.
 - Move the files in Long/t to top-level t folder, and delete Long/t.

0.02
 - Remove Long/t/aab_basic.t. (Served no additional purpose.)
 - Add Long/Long.xs to MANIFEST.

0.01
 - First release.
